Project I did at Sherbrooke University in artificial intelligent class based on logic agents. The goal of the class was to learn basic concepts of artificial intelligence
and solve a maze created by the teacher with these concepts. We used fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm, logical agent and Prolog to solve the maze.
